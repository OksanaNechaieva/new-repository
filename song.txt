Here we are again at the Kazimier Garden
Underneath a slate sky
Your stare is steely and your tongue is sharpened
Can carve me like a steak knife
We used to share that stall and a pair of wine lips
Hips pressed up against the wall
You know I tried my best to turn your black eyes hazel
And kiss away your cruelty
I gladly got undressed, put all my cards on the table
And by cards, I mean me
Apple in mouth, then you left town
Ran after you until my legs gave out
I came crawlin' in on all fours
Knockin' at your door
Knockin' at your door
I don't wanna bleed anymore
I just wanted love
But you wanted gore
You're my matador
