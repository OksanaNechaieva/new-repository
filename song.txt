Here we are again at the Kazimier Garden
Underneath a slate sky
Your stare is steely and your tongue is sharpened
Can carve me like a steak knife
We used to share that stall and a pair of wine lips
Hips pressed up against the wall
You know I tried my best to turn your black eyes hazel
And kiss away your cruelty
I gladly got undressed, put all my cards on the table
And by cards, I mean me
Apple in mouth, then you left town
Ran after you until my legs gave out
I came crawlin' in on all fours
Knockin' at your door
Knockin' at your door
I don't wanna bleed anymore
I just wanted love
But you wanted gore
You're my matador
Here we are again at the Kazimier Garden
The music is getting stranger
Your cape is crimson and you're wavin' it, snarlin'
The air is full of danger
I only wanted to put on a little skirt, a little show for you
You said, "Babe, this ain't the Moulin fuckin' Rouge"
I came crawlin' in on all fours
Knockin' at your door
Knockin' at your door
I don't wanna bleed anymore
I just wanted love
But you wanted gore
You're my matador
You're my matador
He said, "Look, look, look what she's done
She's gone and smashed me up for fun
Oh, someone better find her
Make her pay for all of this fine china
Poke, poke, poke until she bites
Until she's full of spit and spite"
I said, "At least my rage is red
It's the closest to love that you'll ever get"
I came crawlin' in on all fours
Knockin' at your door
Knockin' at your door
I don't wanna bleed anymore
I just wanted love
But you wanted gore
You're my matador
You're my matador, you're
You're my matador
You're my matador
You're my matador
You're my matador
